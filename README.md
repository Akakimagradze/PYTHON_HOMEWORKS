5) Stages of selection:
       Stage I - technical selection of registered applications
       Stage II - Skills Test
       Stage III - Technical Task
       Stage IV - 30 of the remaining participants should be selected on the basis of a personal interview - on the basis of their additional knowledge, motivation and soft skills.
