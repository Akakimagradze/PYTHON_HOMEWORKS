# About Assignments:
    Tasks start from simple and each subsequent task is more difficult than the previous one.
    Each assignment is checked by lecturers who have years of experience in the Python language.
    For each uploaded task, the students of the course opened pull requests where we invited
    lecturers as collaborators and then they corrected our mistakes or offered us a better
    variation to solve the task.

# What soft skills did I gain after completing this course?

1. Teamwork - During the course, the lecturers divided us into groups of 3-4 people
   to work on projects of different complexity.
2. Ability to solve problems - To complete each task, it was necessary to solve a problem,
   therefore, since each subsequent task was more difficult than the previous one, I developed
   the ability to solve problems of varying difficulty based on practice.
3. Time Management - Each assignment had a deadline, and if the student failed to complete
   3 assignments within the deadline, the student would be removed from the course.
   With this approach, I developed the ability to manage time.
